- File : `sensor_msgs/JointState.msg`
- Raw Message Definition

  ```py
  # This is a message that holds data to describe the state of a set of torque controlled joints.
  #
  # The state of each joint (revolute or prismatic) is defined by:
  #  * the position of the joint (rad or m),
  #  * the velocity of the joint (rad/s or m/s) and
  #  * the effort that is applied in the joint (Nm or N).
  #
  # Each joint is uniquely identified by its name
  # The header specifies the time at which the joint states were recorded. All the joint states
  # in one message have to be recorded at the same time.
  #
  # This message consists of a multiple arrays, one for each part of the joint state.
  # The goal is to make each of the fields optional. When e.g. your joints have no
  # effort associated with them, you can leave the effort array empty.
  #
  # All arrays in this message should have the same size, or be empty.
  # This is the only way to uniquely associate the joint name with the correct
  # states.
