## [Multi-Turn Clear Packet](#multi-turn-clear-packet)

DYNAMIXEL-Y is capable of backing up Multi-Turn position information, ensuring that it is preserved even after a power outage. A Multi-Turn Clear Packet is required to reset this value. After a Multi-Turn Clear, DYNAMIXEL will undergo a reboot.  
After replacing the Multi-Turn backup battery, it is essential to perform this process prior to resuming operation.

| Packet Type      | P1   | P2 ~ P5                                | Description                                                                            |
|:----------------:|:----:|:--------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Multi-Turn Clear | 0x01 | Fixed value<br />(0x44 0x58 0x4C 0x22) | Sets the current position (Present Position) value to an absolute position within one revolution based on the motor. Can be cleared only when the motor is not in motion.<br />If the Clear Instruction Packet is sent while Torque Enable is active, the Error field in the Status Packet will display Result Fail (0x01). |
| Error Clear      | 0x02 | Fixed value<br />(0x45 0x52 0x43 0x4C) | Clear errors that occurred in DYNAMIXEL.<br />If an error cannot be cleared or the conditions for clearance are not met, the error remains uncleared, and Result Fail (0x01) is displayed in the Error field of the Status Packet. |



**Note**: Multi-Turn Clear resets the motor's absolute position value to within one revolution. Models with an attached reducer may lose their reducer-based absolute position. To prevent this issue, move the reducer's absolute position to 0 before proceeding with the Multi-Turn Clear process.

## [Error Clear Packet](#error-clear-packet)

The Error Clear Packet can be used to clear the error state of a DYNAMIXEL Y actuator without requiring a restart of the device. When there is an active error registered to the device, it can be cleared using a [Clear Instruction Packet]. If the error is unable to be cleared, the returned status packet will indicate a Failed result (0x01).

# [Multi-Turn backup Battery Replacement](#multi-turn-backup-battery-replacement)

DYNAMIXEL-Y features an internal battery for Multi-Turn Position Backup. After replacing the battery, it is necessary to perform the Multi-Turn Clear operation to reset the Multi-Turn position to ensure accuracy.
