![](/assets/images/icon_unfold.png) Read more about **TurtleBot3 Simulation**
</summary>
TurtleBot3 supports simulation development environment that can be programmed and developed with a virtual robot in the simulation. There are two development environments to do this, one is using a **fake node with 3D visualization tool RViz**, and the other is using the **3D robot simulator Gazebo**.

- The **fake node** is suitable for testing with the robot model and movement, but it does not support sensors.
-  If you need to perform SLAM or Navigation, **Gazebo** would be a feasible solution as it supports sensors such as IMU, LDS, and camera.

In this instruction, Gazebo will be mainly introduced which is most widely used among ROS developers.

This Gazebo Simulation uses **ROS Gazebo package**, therefore, proper Gazebo version must to be installed before running this instruction.

### [Launch Simulation](#launch-simulation)

If you are running ROS1 Noetic, please replace `melodic` with `noetic` in the command below.  

1. To start the simulation, open one elevated command prompt.  
  ```
> c:\opt\ros\melodic\x64\setup.bat
> c:\ws\turtlebot3\devel\setup.bat
> set TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle
> roslaunch turtlebot3_fake turtlebot3_fake.launch
  ```

2. Then, open another elevated command prompt.
  ```
c:\opt\ros\melodic\x64\setup.bat
c:\ws\turtlebot3\devel\setup.bat
set TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle
roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_simulation.launch
  ```
