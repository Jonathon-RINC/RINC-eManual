The TurtleBot3 can be moved in a 2D plane using `point (x, y)` and `z-angular` instructions. For example, if you send (0.5, 0.3, 60), the TurtleBot3 moves to point (x = 0.5m, y = 0.3m) and then rotates to face 60 degrees.

**[Remote PC]** launch the pointop file.

```bash
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_example turtlebot3_pointop_key.launch
```
