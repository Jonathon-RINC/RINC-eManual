- The robot will create a path to reach the Navigation2 Goal based on the global path planner. Then, the robot moves along the path. If an obstacle is placed in the path, Navigation2 will use local path planner to avoid the obstacle.

- Setting a Navigation2 Goal might fail if the path to the Navigation2 Goal cannot be created. If you wish to stop the robot before it reaches to the goal position, set the current position of TurtleBot3 as a Navigation2 Goal.
