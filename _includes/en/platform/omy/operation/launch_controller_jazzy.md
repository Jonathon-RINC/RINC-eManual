The OMY controller has been restructured to utilize the ros2_control framework and MoveIt for enhanced flexibility, modularity, and usability. This updated controller allows for seamless integration with ROS 2-based systems, offering advanced features such as trajectory planning, real-time control, and state feedback.

### Launch Controller

Close all terminal and enter the command below in each new terminal.
```bash
$ ros2 launch open_manipulator_bringup omy_f3m.launch.py
```
