5. Create a task constructor with OMY.  
- Click the `Read task` button to prepare for saving tasks.  
(You can create or modify the pre-saved joint values in the **robot_joint_log.csv** file. The file's load path can be checked in the terminal when the GUI node is launched.)  
- Adjust the manipulator's posture and save it by clicking `Save pose`.  
- Save multiple postures to complete the preparation.
